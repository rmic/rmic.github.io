> _A stash of ideas, side quests, and near misses._

Welcome to my stash of projects, write-ups, and experiments across software engineering, data engineering, MLOps and other various (sometimes only loosely) related topics...

This blog is meant to share reusable stuff that I tried and that actually works (or at least that "works on my machine ¯\_(ツ)_/¯'), the things I googled and fought with so you don't have to, the so-called "solutions" that chat gipitty (or g-pity ?) gave and that I struggled with and finally fixed because the stuff it generated didn't work at first.
